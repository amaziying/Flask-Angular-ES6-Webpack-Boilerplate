# Flask-Angular-es6-Webpack-Boilerplate-
This is a boilerplate plate project for starting an application with flask and angular using webpack and es6

To start the project, clone this repo and run "npm install" in the project root directory.
This will allow webpack to compile and concatenate all the dependencies as well as fire up the flask server.

For development, open a seperate terminal and run "webpack --watch" or "node_modules/.bin/webpack --watch" depending on if you have webpack exposed or not.
This will allow webpack to listen to all the changes.
