# Flask-Angular-ES6-Webpack-Boilerplate
This is a boilerplate project for starting an application with flask and angular using webpack and es6

To start the project, clone this repo and run:

pip install -r requirement.txt

This will install flask.

Then run:

"npm install"

in the project root directory, this will allow webpack to compile and concatenate all the dependencies as well as fire up the flask server.

For development, open a seperate terminal and run:

 "webpack --watch" or "node_modules/.bin/webpack --watch"

depending on if you have webpack exposed or not, this will allow webpack to listen to all the changes.
